Day after day, alone on a hill, The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still But nobody wants to know him, They can see he's just a fool And he never gives an answer. But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. Well on the way, head in a cloud, The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud. But nobody ever hears him Or the sound he appearss to make And he never seems to notice. But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. And nobody seems to like him, They can tell what he wants to do And he never shows his feelings. But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round. He never listens to them, He knows that they're the fools They don't like him. The fool on the hill sees the sun going down And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.  Your day breaks, your mind aches, You find that all her words of kindness linger on, When she no longer needs you.  She wakes up, she makes up, She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry, She no longer needs you.  And in her eyes you see nothing, No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one, A love that should have lasted years.  You want her, you need her, And yet you don't believe her, When she says her love is dead, You think she needs you.  And in her eyes you see nothing, No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one, A love that should have lasted years.  You stay home, she goes out, She says that long ago she knew someone but now, He's gone, she doesn't need him.  Your day breaks, your mind aches, There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head, You won't forget her.  And in her eyes you see nothing, No sign of love behind the tears cried for no one, A love that should have lasted years.

When I call her on the telephone, She says: baby, I'm all alone. By the time I count from one to four, She'll be knocking on my door.  In the evening when the sun goes down And there ain't nobody else around, She kisses me and she holds me tight. She says: baby everything is alright. That's why I know, that's why I know Hallelujah I just love her so. Hallelujah I just love her so, Hallelujah I just love that chick so  She's not a girl who misses much.

There, running my hands through her hair, Both of us thinking how good it can be. Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there. I want her ev'rywhere, and if she's beside me I know I need never care, But to love her is to meet her ev'rywhere, Knowing that love is to share, Each one believing that love never dies, Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there. To be there and ev'rywhere, Here, there and ev'rywhere.  Sheep dog standing in the rain. Bull frog doing it again. Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles.

I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me, I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be. Although I laugh and I act like a clown, Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown, My tears are falling like rain from the sky, Is it for her or myself that I cry. I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me, I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be. What I have done to deserve such a fate, I realize I have left it too late. And so it's true pride comes before a fall, I'm telling you so that you won't lose all. I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me, I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be.

Lovely Rita meter maid, May I inquire discreetly, When you are free, To take some tea with me.  Took her out and tried to win her, Had a laugh and over dinner, Told her I would really like to see her again.

Picture yourself in a boat on a river, With tangerine trees and marmalade skies Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, Towering over your head. Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, And she's gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies, Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, That grow so incredibly high.  Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, Waiting to take you away. Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, And you're gone.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds,  Picture yourself on a train in a station, With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile, The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.  Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head, Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead. Back in school again, Maxwell plays the fool again, teacher gets annoyed, Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene, She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away, So he waits behind, Writing fifty times I must not be so But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind, Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head, Bang bang Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead. P.C. thirty-one said, we've caught a dirty one, Maxwell stands alone Painting testimonial pictures oh oh oh oh. Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery say he must go free.

We said our goodbyes (on the night before), Love was in your eyes Now today I find, you have changed your mind, Treat me like you did the night before. Last night is the I will remember you by, When I think of things you did it makes me wanna cry. Were you telling lies (on the night before)? Was I so unwise (on the night before)? When I held you near, you were so sincere, Treat me like you did the night before.  This happened once before, When I came to your door, no reply. They said it wasn't you, But I saw you peep through your window, I saw the light, I saw the light, I know that you saw me, 'Cos I looked up to see your face. I tried to telephone, They said that you were not home, that's a lie, 'Cos I know where you've been, I saw you walk in your door, I mearly died, I nearly died, 'Cos you walked hand in hand With another man in my place. If I were you I'd realize that I Love you more than any other guy, And I'll forgive the lies that I Heard before when you gave me no reply.

No reply, no reply.  As I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day, I stopped for just a little while to watch the children play. Alone a boy was standing and when I asked him why, he turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry.  I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child. Just like the flowers I'm growing wild. I got no mummy's kisses I got no daddy's smile. Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child.  No mummy's arms to hold me or sue me when I cry, 'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome I wish that I could die. I'll walk the streets of heaven where all blinds can see.  And just like for the other kids it will be a home for me.  I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child. Just like the flowers I'm growing wild. I got no mummy's kisses I got no daddy's smile. Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child.  I once had a girl, Or should I say She once had me. She showed me her room, Isn't it good? Norwegian wood.  She asked me to stay and she told me sit anywhere, So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.  I sat on a rug Biding my time, Drinking her wine. We talked until two, And then she said, 'It's time for bed'.  She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh, I told her I didn't, and crawled off to sleep in the bath.  And when I awoke I was alone, This bird has flown, So I lit a fire, Isn't it good? Norwegian wood.  You know you made me cry, I see no use in wond'ring why, I cried for you. And now, you've changed your mind, I see no reason to change mine, I cried, it's through, oh. Oh, you're giving me the same old line, I'm wond'ring why, You hurt me then, you're back again, No, no, not a second time. You know you made me cry, I see no use in wond'ring why, I cried for you, yeh. And now, you've changed your mind, I see no reason to change mine, I cried, it's through, oh. Oh, you're giving me the same old line, I'm wond'ring why, You hurt me then, you're back again, No, no, not a second time.  Not guilty for getting in your way while you're trying to steal the day. Not guilty and I'm not here for the rest, I'm not trying to steal your vest. I am not trying to be smart, I only want what I can get. I'm really sorry for your ageing head. But like you heard me said: not guilty. No use handing me a writ while I'm trying to do my bit. I don't expect to take your heart. I only want what I can get. I'm really sorry that you're underfed.

Why must she be such a doggone tease? There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees. She's got a way that makes me act like a fool. Spent my money, then she plays me cool. I beg her for kisses on my bended knees. Oh won't you give me some loving, baby, please please please. Though I keep trying hard to make her mine, one day the wind will blow and the sun will shine. Till that time she puts my heart at ease. There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees She locked my heart and threw away the keys. There's nothing shaking but the leaves on the trees, yeah.

I'd ask my friends to come and see an octopus's garden with me. I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade. We would be warm below the storm in our little hide-a-way beneath the waves. Resting our head on the sea bed in an octopus's garden near a cave. We would sing and dance around because we know we can't be found. I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden in the shade. We would shout and swim about the coral that lies beneath the waves. Oh what joy for every girl and boy knowing they're happy and they're safe. We would be so happy, you and me, no-one there to tell us what to do, I'd like to be under the sea in an octopus's garden with you.  Oh!

I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, Baby I'm in love with you, I'm so glad you cam here it won't be the same now I'm telling you. You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down, And when I see your smile replacing ev'ry thoughtless frown, Got me escaping from this zoo, Baby I'm in love with you, I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now I'm telling you. If I grow up I'll be a singer, Wearing rings on every finger, Not worrying what they or you say. I'll live and love and maybe some day, Who knows baby, You may comfort me. I may appear to be imperfect, My love is something you can't reject, I'm changing faster than the weather, If you and me should get together, Who knows baby You may comfort me. I want that love of yours To miss that love is something I'd hate, I'll make an early start I'm making sure that I'm not late, For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue, Baby I'm in love with you, I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you. I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you.  My baby says she's trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine. I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line. I said move over once, move over twice, Come on baby don't be cold as ice. I said I'm trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine. I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees, You're only fooling around, you're fooling around with me. I said move over once, move over twice, Come on baby don't be cold as ice. I said I'm trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine. I've got my bag, Run to the station. Railman says you've got the wrong location. I've got my bag. Run right home. Then I find I've got the number wrong, Well I said I'm trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine. I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line. I said move over once, move over twice, Come on baby don't be cold as ice. I said we're trav'ling on the One after Nine-o, I said we're trav'ling on the One after Nine-O, I said we're trav'ling on the One after Nine-O-Nine.  If you're listening to this song You might think the chords are going wrong But they're not; we just wrote them like that When you're listening late at night You may think the band are not quite right But they are, they just play it like that It doesn't really matter what chords I play What words I say or what time of day it is As it's only a Northern song It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear Or how I fare or if my hair is brown When it's only a Northern song. If you think the harmony Is a little dark and out of key You're correct, there's nobody there. And I told you there's no one there.  Ooh! My soul.

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs Of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to know. And all the people that come and go Stop and say 'Hello'.  On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, The little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain - very strange.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back  In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It's a clean machine.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, A four of fish and finger pies In summer meanwhile back  Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she's in a play She is anyway.  In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain - very strange.  Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes, There beneath the blue suburban skies... Penny Lane!  Have you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt? And for all the little piggies life is getting worse, Always having dirt to play around in.  Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts? You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt, Always have clean shirts to play around in.  In their styes with all their backing they don't care what goes on around, In their eyes there's something lacking, What they need's a damn good whacking.  Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggie lives, You can see them out for dinner with their piggie wives, Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

Do what you want to do, And go where you're going to, Think for yourself,  'Cos I won't be there with you, I left you far behind The ruins of the life that you had in mind. And though you still can't see, I know your mind's made up, You're gonna cause more misery. Do what you want to do, And go where you're going to, Think for yourself,  'Cos I won't be there with you. Although your mind's opaque, Try thinking more, If just for your own sake. The future still looks good, And you've got time to rectify All the things that you should. Do what you want to do, And go where you're going to, Think for yourself,  'Cos I won't be there with you.

Turn off your mind relax and float down-stream, It is not dying, it is not dying, Lay down all thought surrender to the void, It is shining, it is shining.  That you may see the meaning of within, It is being, it is being, That love is all and love is everyone, It is knowing, it is knowing.  That ignorance and haste may mourn the dead, It is believing, it is believing, But listen to the color of your dreams, It is not living, it is not living.  Or play the game "existence" to the end. Of the beginning, of the beginning. Of the beginning. Of the beginning.  Running to and fro, hard working at the mill, never failed at the mill, there come a rotten bill.

We were talking - about the space between us all And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion Never glimpse the truth - then itâ€™s far too late - when they pass away.  We were talking - about the love we all could share - when we find it To try our best to hold it there - with our love With our love - we could save the world - if they only knew.  Try to realize it's all within yourself No-one else can make you change And to see you're really only very small, And life flows on within you and without you.  We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold and the people, Who gain the world and lose their soul - They don't know - they can't see - are you one of them?  When you've seen beyond yourself - Then you may find peace of mind, is waiting there - And the time will come when you see we're all one, And life flows on within you and without you.

Out of college money spent See no future pay no rent. All the money's gone, nowhere to go.  Any Jobber got the sack, Monday morning turning back. Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go. But oh - that magic feeling nowhere to go. One sweet dream  Pick up the bags and get in the limousine. Soon we'll be away from here. Step on the gas and wipe that tear away,  One sweet dream came true today, came true today. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, All good children go to heaven.

I have had enough, so act your age, We have lost the time that was so hard to find, And I will lose my mind, If you won't see me, you won't see me.  I don't know why you should want to hide, But I can't get through my hands are tied, I won't want to stay I don't have much to say, But I can turn away. And you won't see me, you won't see me.  Time after time you refuse to even listen, I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing. Though the days are few they're filled with tears, And since I lost you it feels like years, Yes it seems so long girl since you've been gone, And I just can't go on, If you won't see me, you won't see me.

Here I stand with head in hand, Turn my face to the wall. If she's gone I can't go on, Feeling two foot small.  Ev'rywhere people stare, Each and ev'ry day. I can see them laugh at me, And I hear them say.  Hey, you've got to hide your love away. Hey, you've got to hide your love away.  How can I even try, I can never win, Hearing them, seeing them, In the state I'm in.  How could she say to me Love will find a way? Gather round all you clowns Let me hear you say.  Hey, you've got to hide your love away. Hey, you've got to hide your love away.  I saw her standing on the corner, a yellow ribbon in her hair. I couldn't stop myself from calling: look a-there, look a-there, look a-there, look a-there.  Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. I can't get you out of my mind. I took one look and I was fractured, I tried to walk but I was lame. I tried to talk but I just stuttered:  well what's your name, what's your name, well what's your name, what's your name.  Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. I can't get you out of my mind. A crazy stop, she was the top, I tried to follow her all the way home. Things went bad, I met her dad he said: you'd better leave my daughter alone.  Well I tried to I saw the rising of the sun, and all along my heart was falling, while you're the one, you're the one, while you're the one, you're the one,  Young Blood, Young Blood, Young Blood. I can't get you out of my mind. A crazy stop, she was the top, I tried to follow her all the way home. Things went bad, I met her dad he said: you'd better leave my daughter alone.
